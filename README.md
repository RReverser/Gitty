This is a repo for tracking issues for [Gitty](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/gitty/16998cba-b1d7-4d82-a8d0-131a40009168) - an unofficial Windows client for [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) — real-time messaging service built specifically to help teams communicate better.

Features:
  - Login through Github ⇒ Gitter account
  - View, search and join Gitter rooms
  - Chat with other room participants in real-time

Please note that this is a free app, so if you find it useful but feel that some critical feature is missing:
  1. Create an issue.
  2. Add bounty to it via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/).

That way issue will be funded for development and I'll be able to spend time on it instead of primary work.
